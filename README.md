# Modern python

Personally curated list of tools and tutorials to bootstrap a modern python project.
Inspired by https://github.com/xandrade/Talkpython.fm-Notable-Packages- & based on Talk Python series (some packages will be crossed over).

## Debugging

* [Loguru](https://github.com/Delgan/loguru#ready-to-use-out-of-the-box-without-boilerplate)
* [Notifiers](https://github.com/liiight/notifiers)

## Typing, hints, annotations and more

* [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) - Data validation and settings management using Python type annotations.

## Workflows & QA

* [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/) - The pytest framework makes it easy to write small, readable tests, and can scale to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries.
* [Faker](https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/) - Faker is a Python package that generates fake data for you.
* [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - Python library for creating unit tests which are simpler to write and more powerful when run, finding edge cases in your code you wouldnâ€™t have thought to look for.
* [Pants](https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/welcome-to-pants#who-is-pants-for) - Fast, scalable, user-friendly build and developer workflow system for codebases of all sizes, including yours!
* [Schemathesis](https://schemathesis.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - Specification-centric API testing tool for Open API and GraphQL-based applications.
* [factory_boy](https://factoryboy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - As a fixtures replacement tool, it aims to replace static, hard to maintain fixtures with easy-to-use factories for complex objects.
* [MyPy](http://mypy-lang.org/) - Optional static type checker for Python that aims to combine the benefits of dynamic (or "duck").
* [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) - The uncompromising Python code formatter. 

## ORMs & ODMs

* [Piccolo](https://piccolo-orm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) - Piccolo is a modern, async query builder and ORM for Python, with lots of batteries included.
* [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) - SQLAlchemy is the Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL.
* [SQLModel](https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/) - A library for interacting with SQL databases from Python code, with Python objects. It is designed to be intuitive, easy to use, highly compatible, and robust.
* [Gino](https://github.com/python-gino/gino) -  GINO Is Not ORM - a Python asyncio ORM on SQLAlchemy core.

* [Beanie](https://github.com/roman-right/beanie) -  Asynchronous Python ODM for MongoDB.

## Async Python

* [httpx](https://www.python-httpx.org/) - Fully featured HTTP client for Python 3, which provides sync and async APIs, and support for both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.
* [aioredis](https://aioredis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - Simple and clear interface to Redis based on asyncio.
* [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html#module-asyncio) - asyncio is a library to write concurrent code using the async/await syntax.

## Fast Python

* [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) - An open source JIT compiler that translates a subset of Python and NumPy code into fast machine code. 
* [Vaex](https://github.com/vaexio/vaex) - Out-of-Core hybrid Apache Arrow/NumPy DataFrame for Python, ML, visualization and exploration of big tabular data at a billion rows per second rocket.
* [Multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html) - Split your jobs between CPU cores.
* [Threading](https://realpython.com/intro-to-python-threading/) - An Intro to Threading in Python

## Fastapi

* [Fastapi best practices](https://github.com/vlntsolo/fastapi-best-practices)
* [SQLModel](https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/) - a library for interacting with SQL databases from Python code, with Python objects. It is designed to be intuitive, easy to use, highly compatible, and robust.
